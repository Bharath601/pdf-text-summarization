# Text Summarization Application

## Introduction
Welcome to the Text Summarization Application, a project that utilizes advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformers to provide state-of-the-art text summarization services.

## Features
- **Text and PDF Summarization:** This feature enables the condensation of large documents into concise and coherent summaries.
- **Chat-Bot Feature:** Provides contextual responses to queries based on the summarized text, enhancing user interaction and understanding.
- **Grammar Correction:** This functionality ensures the quality of summaries by correcting grammatical errors.

## Technological Stack
- **Front-End:** React.js for a dynamic user interface.
- **Back-End:** Flask for efficient processing of requests.
- **Main Technologies:** The project employs Transformers, TextBlob, PyPDF2, and PyTorch.
- **Models Used:** Pegasus for Summarization, BERT for the Chat-Bot functionality.

## Architecture
The application integrates a React-based front-end for user interaction with a Flask back-end for processing and responding to requests. It includes various routes for handling text summarization, chat-bot interactions, and grammar correction.

## Future Enhancements
Future plans include the integration of a database for storing user data and the fine-tuning of models for enhanced performance. This includes particularly focusing on the BERT model, with an aim to leverage the SQuAD 2.0 dataset for improved chat-bot responses.
